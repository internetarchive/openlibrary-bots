You can also find more information regarding Developer Documentation for Open Library in the Open Library [Wiki](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/)

Typically every folder signifies a different bot. The folder must contain code with respect to the bot, a `README.md` file which tells the user how to run the bot and any dependencies or `requirements.txt` file which can make it easier for a user to run the bot.
