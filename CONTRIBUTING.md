## Pull Requests

* Pull Requests (PRs) must link to the issue they resolve. Please expect PRs without corresponding issues to be rejected until an issue is retroactively created and linked to it.

* When your code is ready for review, please follow our [Pull Request Template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to close the corresponding issue.

## Documentation

* Every Bot has documentation within the Bot folder as a `README.md` file. Also check out [Github Wiki](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-bots/wiki) and look for the Bot Documentation for more information regarding the Bot.

* Every Bot has certain data files which are uploaded on `archive.org` and can be readily accessed. In case you are looking to add a new data file for a particular bot, contact the maintainer for that bot for more information on how to access the `archive.org` access.
